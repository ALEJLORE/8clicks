The code you've provided appears to be a configuration file in an INI file format. INI files are often used to store settings and configuration parameters for various software applications. Here's an explanation of each line:

```ini
[Config]
```

- `[Config]`: This line defines a section header within the INI file. All the configuration settings below this header belong to the "Config" section.

```ini
command_prompt=show
```

- `command_prompt=show`: This line specifies a configuration setting named "command_prompt" and assigns it the value "show." The meaning of this setting depends on the context in which this configuration file is used. It likely indicates a specific action or behavior related to a software application. In this case, it's set to "show."

```ini
server_port=8080
```

- `server_port=8080`: This line specifies a configuration setting named "server_port" and assigns it the value "8080." This setting typically determines the port number on which a server or application will listen for incoming network connections. In this case, the server is configured to listen on port 8080.

```ini
root_directory=mikhmon
```

- `root_directory=mikhmon`: This line sets the "root_directory" configuration setting to "mikhmon." The "root_directory" often defines the base directory from which a web server or application serves its content. In this case, it's set to "mikhmon."

```ini
php_folder=php
```

- `php_folder=php`: This line configures the "php_folder" setting to "php." The purpose of this setting depends on the context of its usage. It might indicate the directory where PHP scripts or files are stored or executed from.

```ini
exe_name=mphp-server.exe
```

- `exe_name=mphp-server.exe`: This line assigns the value "mphp-server.exe" to the "exe_name" configuration setting. This setting likely specifies the name of an executable file. The file named "mphp-server.exe" is mentioned, and it might be associated with running or managing the server or application.

Overall, this INI file appears to store important configuration parameters for a software application, but the exact functionality and meaning of these parameters would depend on the specific software that uses this configuration file.
